# Spam Classifier using Random Forest

## Introduction
A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. In this notebook, you will learn how to use the countvectorizer class of scikit learn to create the bag of words which are related to spam.

## Dataset
Have a look at the dataset [link](https://github.com/ra=jatsharma369007/Spam_Classifier_using_Naive_Bayes/blob/master/SMSSpamCollection)  
Dataset contains first columns as classification label and second column is the e-mail content.

## Installation
* Pandas  
<code>conda install pandas</code>
* Scikit learn  
<code>conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn</code>

## Score Achieved
* acuracy score = 0.97
* precision score = 1.0
* recall score = 0.84
* f1 score = 0.91
